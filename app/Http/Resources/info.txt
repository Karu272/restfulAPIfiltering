We need to cut down on the information we give to the ppl who use our API
there for we use php artisan make:reasource V1/CustomerResource to make a file
that will scale down on the columns we are showing in the API

All we need to do is return an array with the right spellings because we use json
which expected syntax is i different from Laravel and html

this works only for 1 specific id in the API array. There for we make another file
called CustumerCollection which we filter every id in the array the same way.
